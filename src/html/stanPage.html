            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">Personality</h4>
            <p>
            <p>Stan is generally the most tender and sensitive of the four boys. For example, in "Kenny Dies", he finds
                it difficult to see Kenny in his ill state, and in "Raisins" he becomes depressed after losing his
                girlfriend to Tolkien. Also, in "Fun with Veal", Stan is the only one who stopped eating meat completely
                when the boys found that veal was actually "tortured baby cow meat". However, in some episodes he does
                not seem to care when people die, as in "Dances with Smurfs" and "Chef Goes Nanners".</p>
            <p>Stan is often very moral. This is evident in "Cherokee Hair Tampons", when he, Kenny, Timmy, and Butters
                challenged the character Miss Information and her shop of alternative medicine, in "Super Best Friends",
                when he helped battle David Blaine's suicidal cult, and in "The Biggest Douche in the Universe" where he
                accuses the psychic medium, John Edward, of being a fake. In this episode he also gained possession of
                his own show (while trying to prove that cold reading was fake) and battled with John Edward in a
                "Psychic Showdown".</p>
            <p>
                He also showed some heroism in "Cherokee Hair Tampons" by stating he would gladly donate a kidney to
                Kyle, even if it "hurt a whole lot". In "Whale Whores", he was also the only one in South Park to stand
                up and help whales and dolphins that were being slaughtered by the Japanese. He was angry that the cast
                of Whale Wars was not doing enough to help whales and dolphins and took matters into his own hands. It
                also shows Stan is a whale and dolphin lover and he tells the Japanese that it was a cow and a chicken
                that nuked Hiroshima, not a whale and a dolphin, in order to save them all being wiped out by the
                Japanese.
            </p>
            <p>He is usually the one who is unaffected by the many scams, cults, and mass influences that South Park has
                been subjected to, and has a knack for seeing through falsely glorified practices and celebrities. In
                "Trapped in the Closet" and "Ass Burgers", he is the only one of the boys shown to believe in scams,
                cults, and that an alien makes everyone see things normal. Conversely, sometimes Kyle takes on this
                role, and it is Stan who is the gullible one, such as in "Chinpokomon", or the metrosexual trend in
                "South Park is Gay!".</p>
            <p>However, Stan has been shown to have an overwhelmingly clearer understanding of scams and corporate
                corruption than anyone else in South Park, and has an especially good grasp of the dangers of cults. It
                is notable that he has a tendency to ridicule, make enemies out of, and/or bring shame to a very large
                number of celebrities that are shown in a poor light within the show. This may be because his father
                (Stan's major adult influence) has shown to be rather incompetent and immature, so Stan is suspicious
                and distrustful of adults.</p>
            <p>Stan and Kyle's personalities tend to be similar, especially in the earlier seasons, but are not quite
                interchangeable, and they have developed more distinct and complex personalities during the show's run.
                Still, they are considered the closest friends out of the four, though Cartman and Kenny do not have a
                close bond of their own.</p>
            <p>Stan's depression is also a recurring theme throughout the show. He became terribly depressed when Wendy
                broke up with him in "Raisins", briefly joining the Goth Kids. Stan also became incredibly depressed and
                adopted a cynical world view in "You're Getting Old" and "Ass Burgers", where everything to him
                literally sounded and looked "like shit". In "Ass Burgers", he uses alcohol to make the world seem
                happier.</p>
            <p>Stan may suffer from asthma, as an inhaler was shown among the things Cartman claims in "Sexual
                Harassment Panda", although this was never mentioned in the series again.</p>
            <p>Stan is an avid animal lover - he gets a dog in "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride". He resists the
                influence of his uncle Jimbo to hunt in "Volcano" (he mentions this in "Death"), became a P.E.T.A.
                member in "Douche and Turd" (although he had the choice of joining them or being killed), tried to save
                baby cows in "Fun with Veal", and attempted to return a goat to its rightful owners in "Osama bin Laden
                Has Farty Pants". Although well-intentioned, these interventions often lead him and his friends into
                serious trouble. Stan (as well as the rest of the boys from 4th grade) also went to Mexico and managed
                to get the Mexican Space Program to take an orca to the moon in a bid to save it (with all the kids in
                South Park having been led to believe he was a killer whale from the moon) in "Free Willzyx". In "Two
                Days Before the Day After Tomorrow", after he and Cartman crash a boat into a beaver dam and swim to
                shore, seeing the boat blow up, Stan says, "I hope we didn't hurt any beavers." In "Fun with Veal" he
                briefly turned to vegetarianism, but he quickly gave it up when he was plagued by a disease that
                literally "turned him into a pussy", sprouting actual vaginas on his body, a disease called Vaginitis.
                He also sets out to save the whales and dolphins from the Japanese in "Whale Whores". It is revealed in
                "Rainforest Shmainforest" that he is afraid of snakes.</p>
            </p>

            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Leadership</h4>
            <p>
            <p>tan shows his leadership skills as (Pirate) Captain Marsh of the Sea Shepherd in "Whale Whores". He sinks
                several of the Japanese boats to protect the whales and dolphins in the Ocean until their boat was hit
                by Japanese kamikaze planes. Stan is often selected to be the captain of assorted sporting events such
                as captain and pitcher of the baseball team in "The Losing Edge" and captain/quarterback in football as
                seen in "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride". When the boys are playing police in "Lil' Crime Stoppers",
                Stan acts in the role of a lead detective during the investigations. Although there is no specific
                leader within his primary group of friends, Stan is often the one to motivate the other boys, due to his
                moral beliefs, as seen in episodes such as Fun with Veal.</p>
            </p>
            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Talents</h4>
            <p>
            <p>Music
                In earlier episodes, such as "Summer Sucks" and "World Wide Recorder Concert", Stan began to show an
                aptitude for music. He is also shown to be capable of writing music, as seen in "Chef Aid".</p>
            <p>In "Something You Can Do with Your Finger", he and the boys started a boy-band group named Fingerbang.
                They made a video for the song "Fingerbang" and performed it at the South Park Mall.</p>
            <p>In "Die Hippie, Die", he was seen playing guitar. He was also seen playing a guitar in "Smug Alert!",
                where he wrote and performed a song about the importance of hybrid cars.</p>
            <p>In "You Got F'd in the A", his father taught him how to line dance to the song, "Achy Breaky Heart" by
                Billy Ray Cyrus. He and the rest of The South Park Diggities participated successfully in a dance
                competition with The Orange County Crew.</p>
            <p>In "Christian Rock Hard", the boys formed a rock band, called Moop. The group refused to play their music
                in a protest of illegal music downloading on the internet.</p>
            <p>Stan has been shown to be able to play Guitar Hero very well in "Guitar Queer-O". He was able to
                successfully achieve his goal of scoring 1,000,000 points with Kyle in cooperative mode.</p>
            <p>In "Night of the Living Homeless", he and the boys sang "California Loves the Homeless" to a large crowd
                of homeless people, in an effort to drive them away from South Park.</p>
            <p>In "Pandemic" and "Pandemic 2: The Startling", the boys formed a Peruvian flute band with Craig Tucker.
                They played "Mary Had a Little Lamb" at an outdoor mall in Colorado, where they were arrested by the
                Department of Homeland Security.</p>
            <p>In "Band in China", Stan forms a heavy metal band called Crimson Dawn, which consists of him as the lead
                singer, Kenny as bassist, Butters as the lead guitarist, and Jimmy as the drummer.</p>
