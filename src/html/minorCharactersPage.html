                        class="al-gore-image img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Al Gore image">

                    <p>Al Gore was the 45th Vice President of the United States under the Clinton administration from
                        1993 until 2001, and ran for president against George Bush in 2000. He is most notable within
                        the series for trying to alert people of ManBearPig, though he also appears once during his vice
                        presidency, and reappears later to sue the town.</p>

                    <h6>Appearance</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Al Gore originally wore a generic black suit with a thin face and black hair. In Season Ten, his
                        new look included dark brown hair, a blueish gray shirt, and a brown tie. He later began wearing
                        a red cape. In Season Twenty-Two, his look has changed again, with his hair color now gray and
                        having grown a matching beard. He also wears his blueish gray shirt, dark pants, and bowling
                        shoes.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>

                    <hr />
                    <p>Gore appears to be very delusional and deranged, which is shown most when he apparently invents
                        the ManBearPig creature and puts the boys' lives in danger to maintain that fantasy. This might
                        be due to an obsessive need for everyone to admire him as per Stan's description, "You just use
                        ManBearPig to get attention for yourself because you're a loser!". This indicates that Gore has
                        an extreme case of egocentricity as his attention-seeking id√©e fixe has poisoned his mind to the
                        point that he undisputedly believes in the reality of ManBearPig.</p>

                    <p>Gore apparently made up ManBearPig and made it seem real (as far as he thought), so that the
                        world would consider him a hero for "destroying" it, which is all he cares about. His mental
                        creation manifested itself among the other evil characters of Imaginationland and he was willing
                        to destroy Imaginationland along with all of its inhabitants to kill ManBearPig. Believing
                        himself a super-hero of sorts, after donning his cape he began running around acting and talking
                        like Superman. However, ManBearPig was proven to be real in "Time To Get Cereal" where it goes
                        on a rampage in South Park.</p>

                <div id="aslan_the_lion">
                    <h4>Aslan the Lion</h4>

                    <img src="/src/img/characters/minor_characters/aslan.webp" class="aslan-image img-thumbnail rounded"
                        alt="Aslan the Lion image">

                    <p>Aslan the Lion is a character from The Chronicles of Narnia. In South Park, he appears as the
                        leader of the Council of Nine in the "Imaginationland" trilogy, as well as the leader of the
                        lions at the zoo in "Here Comes the Neighborhood". In "Imaginationland", he scares Butters
                        Stotch into using his "Key" powers to revive Santa Claus, and later other good characters, so
                        the good creatures could defeat the evil characters.</p>

                    <h6>Appearance</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>In "Here Comes the Neighborhood", he looks like a regular lion, with brown fur and a large mane.
                        However, in "Imaginationland", he appears more realistic and has green emerald eyes.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>In "Here Comes the Neighborhood", he seems to have a huge sense of humor, even laughing at every
                        joke he hears. In "Imaginationland", his sense of humor is largely gone, replaced by a more
                        serious, commanding attitude.</p>

                <div id="asian_girls">
                    <h4>Asian girls</h4>

                    <p>The Asian Girls are a clique of new students at South Park Elementary who are usually seen
                        sitting on the steps just inside the main entrance to the school, drawing art, particularly
                        Yaoi. They were formally introduced in the Season Nineteen episode, "Tweek x Craig", but a few
                        of them are also seen in "Safe Space". They have since become background characters.</p>

                    <p>There are other Asian-American female students at the school, such as Liza Nelson, who are not
                        considered part of his clique.</p>

                    <img src="/src/img/characters/minor_characters/asian-girls.webp"
                        class="asian-girls-image img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Asian girls image">

                    <h6>Background</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>The Asian Girls are a specific clique consisting of several girls with at least Japanese, Korean,
                        and Chinese heritage, including Lisa Akimoto, Kelly Zhou and Heather Nishimura. They tend to be
                        quiet and keep to themselves, responding to outside events through their art rather than direct
                        action, and sometimes conversing in their native dialects. They all appear to be artists. Many
                        of them also sell their works to others behind Whole Foods in CtPaTown.</p>

                    <p>During "Tweek x Craig", the Asian Girls draw pictures of Tweek and Craig together in a fictitious
                        homosexual relationship, starting a rumor that the two are dating. Wendy Testaburger holds a
                        presentation for the school featuring their art, drawing much attention to them and the rumor,
                        and they are also seen selling their art in CtPaTown. When Tweek and Craig "break up," The Asian
                        girls draw more depressed art to reflect the way the town feels.</p>
