                    <p>
                        <i class="character-name">Al Gore</i> was the 45th Vice President of the United
                        States under the Clinton administration from
                        1993 until 2001, and ran for president against George Bush in 2000. He is most notable within
                        the series for trying to alert people of ManBearPig, though he also appears once during his vice
                        presidency, and reappears later to sue the town.

                    <h6>Appearance</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Al Gore originally wore a generic black suit with a thin face and black hair. In Season Ten, his
                        new look included dark brown hair, a blueish gray shirt, and a brown tie. He later began wearing
                        a red cape. In Season Twenty-Two, his look has changed again, with his hair color now gray and
                        having grown a matching beard. He also wears his blueish gray shirt, dark pants, and bowling
                        shoes.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>

                    <hr />
                    <p>Gore appears to be very delusional and deranged, which is shown most when he apparently invents
                        the ManBearPig creature and puts the boys' lives in danger to maintain that fantasy. This might
                        be due to an obsessive need for everyone to admire him as per Stan's description, "You just use
                        ManBearPig to get attention for yourself because you're a loser!". This indicates that Gore has
                        an extreme case of egocentricity as his attention-seeking idée fixe has poisoned his mind to the
                        point that he undisputedly believes in the reality of ManBearPig.</p>

                    <p>Gore apparently made up ManBearPig and made it seem real (as far as he thought), so that the
                        world would consider him a hero for "destroying" it, which is all he cares about. His mental
                        creation manifested itself among the other evil characters of Imaginationland and he was willing
                        to destroy Imaginationland along with all of its inhabitants to kill ManBearPig. Believing
                        himself a super-hero of sorts, after donning his cape he began running around acting and talking
                        like Superman. However, ManBearPig was proven to be real in "Time To Get Cereal" where it goes
                        on a rampage in South Park.</p>

                        South Park, he appears as the
                        leader of the Council of Nine in the "Imaginationland" trilogy, as well as the leader of the
                        lions at the zoo in "Here Comes the Neighborhood". In "Imaginationland", he scares Butters
                        Stotch into using his "Key" powers to revive Santa Claus, and later other good characters, so
                        the good creatures could defeat the evil characters.</p>

                    <p>In "Here Comes the Neighborhood", he looks like a regular lion, with brown fur and a large mane.
                        However, in "Imaginationland", he appears more realistic and has green emerald eyes.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>In "Here Comes the Neighborhood", he seems to have a huge sense of humor, even laughing at every
                        joke he hears. In "Imaginationland", his sense of humor is largely gone, replaced by a more
                        serious, commanding attitude.</p>

                    <p> <i class="character-name">The Asian Girls</i> are a clique of new students at South Park
                        Elementary who are usually seen
                        sitting on the steps just inside the main entrance to the school, drawing art, particularly
                        Yaoi. They were formally introduced in the Season Nineteen episode, "Tweek x Craig", but a few
                        of them are also seen in "Safe Space". They have since become background characters.</p>

                    <p>There are other Asian-American female students at the school, such as Liza Nelson, who are not
                        considered part of his clique.</p>

                    <hr />

                    <p>The Asian Girls are a specific clique consisting of several girls with at least Japanese, Korean,
                        and Chinese heritage, including Lisa Akimoto, Kelly Zhou and Heather Nishimura. They tend to be
                        quiet and keep to themselves, responding to outside events through their art rather than direct
                        action, and sometimes conversing in their native dialects. They all appear to be artists. Many
                        of them also sell their works to others behind Whole Foods in CtPaTown.</p>

                    <p>During "Tweek x Craig", the Asian Girls draw pictures of Tweek and Craig together in a fictitious
                        homosexual relationship, starting a rumor that the two are dating. Wendy Testaburger holds a
                        presentation for the school featuring their art, drawing much attention to them and the rumor,
                        and they are also seen selling their art in CtPaTown. When Tweek and Craig "break up," The Asian
                        girls draw more depressed art to reflect the way the town feels.</p>

                        Elementary, who appears in the
                        Season Eleven episode, "The Snuke".</p>

                    <p>Baahir has olive skin and curly, black hair, that is shaved around the sides. He wears a
                        sky-blue, button-up shirt and dark gray trousers.</p>

                    <p>He was portrayed as nice and slightly over-trusting, even befriending Butters Stotch and going to
                        his house, despite only knowing Butters for a few hours.</p>
                    <p>Baahir's parents, Mr. Hakeem and Mrs. Hakeem, were kidnapped by Cartman when he was trying to
                        find out the location of their son. He then tortured them by farting in their faces. When they
                        refused to respond, professing that they did not know where Baahir was, Cartman then injected
                        his arm with a syringe full of apple juice, warning them that apple juice gives him "super bad
                        farts". He left them tied up and imprisoned after he found out that Baahir was at Butters'
                        house. Due to their abominable experiences in South Park, the Hakeems moved away at the end of
                        the episode. Cartman rejoiced at this, saying that not only did his bigotry save the country
                        from the real terrorist attacks, but it also got rid of the Muslim family.</p>

                    <p>In "Follow That Egg!", it was revealed that Big Gay Al had started up a relationship with Mr.

                        were instead using the term "Fag" in regards to the Harley Riders, stating "You can be gay, and
                        not a fag". Al and Slave, finding agreement with this, help the boys to change the definition of
                        "faggot" from a gay person to an annoying Harley rider, with Al presiding over meetings in town

                    <p><i class="character-name">Leopold "Butters" Stotch</i> is a major character in the series. He is
                        a fourth-grader in South Park
                        Elementary. Butters' role gradually began to increase after he replaced Kenny during his
                        temporary removal in Season Six. This allowed Butters to gain more screen time and further
                        develop his character. He is the "innocent child" in the group and Cartman's most exploited and
                        possibly best "friend". Butters is loosely based on Eric Stough, an animation director/producer
                        that works on the show.</p>

                    <h6>Background</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Butters has made appearances since "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", though initially as a background
                        character. He gets his first speaking role in the Season Two episode, "Clubhouses". He later
                        receives a speaking role in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.</p>

                    <p>Butters was seen sporadically in seasons three through five, going from a social pariah in "Two
                        Guys Naked in a Hot Tub" to mean-spirited bully in "Hooked on Monkey Fonics".</p>

                    <p>In "Jared Has Aides", Butters was adopted by Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Eric Cartman as
                        their fourth friend when Kenny McCormick died "permanently" at the end of the fifth season. The
                        writers had given Butters his own spotlight episode as the season five finale to prepare fans
                        for Butters taking Kenny's place on the show. The episode, titled "Butters' Very Own Episode",
                        gave Butters a complicated back story where his father was outed as being a closet bisexual and
                        his mother attempted to drown her son Butters in a fit of madness. They all made up at the end
                        of the episode and nothing came of it.</p>

                    <p>Butters found himself as the new fourth friend, being put down and treated like a total outcast
                        by his new friends. Kyle, Stan, and Cartman all openly bullied Butters, telling him how he is
                        not cool like Kenny. Cartman in particular took perverse pleasure in making Butters suffer, to
                        the extent that, in "Jared Has Aides", he pretended to be Butters on the phone and bad-mouthed
                        his parents, just so he could watch them abusing him. Several instances show the boys having
                        Butters dress up as Kenny or simply call him Kenny or Not-Kenny, possibly to cope with their
                        loss.</p>

                    <p>Butters would remain on as the fourth member of the gang for four more episodes; two of the
                        episodes continued the plot of Butters being abused but downplayed it and in the case of "Freak
                        Strike", ending the episode just as Butters was about to be beaten (with Cartman being beaten up
                        instead). Ultimately, in the sixth episode of season six, "Professor Chaos", Butters is expelled
                        from the group for being "too lame" and adopts his super-villain alter ego "Professor Chaos" as
                        a means to get revenge against the group and society for rejecting him. Butters would run around
                        for several episodes as Professor Chaos, only to have no one care much about his plots since
                        many of them had, though Butters did not realize it, already occurred on episodes of the
                        animated series The Simpsons. Butters would eventually reveal his secret identity of Professor
                        Chaos to Stan, although he mistook it for Butters coming out of the closet.</p>

                    <p>Though not anymore a member of the main four's group, Butters was nevertheless kept as a
                        prominent member of the boys' extended circle. Though he has returned, Kenny's role has declined
                        to an extent due to lack of ideas for the character and Butters has taken on a more prominent
                        role again. Despite their ill-treatment toward him, Butters stays loyal to his friends, perhaps
                        in hopes that they will accept him. In a way, this has worked as recently there seems to have
                        been some shift in the balance of friendship. The most obvious case of this being in "Tsst",
                        where Butters is calmly playing along with Stan, Kyle and Kenny, with Cartman being much more
                        alienated than usual, as well as in "Casa Bonita", where Kyle decides to take Butters with him
                        on his birthday to Casa Bonita instead of Cartman, implying he likes Butters more than Cartman.
                        It has been said that Kyle despises Cartman because of his cruel, sadistic and selfish
                        attitudes, as well as his prejudice—especially towards the Jews.</p>

                    <p>Despite their history, Butters has recently taken on the role as Cartman's sidekick. Cartman
                        often takes advantage of Butters' kindness and desire to be accepted in order to fulfill his
                        schemes. Cartman hurts and betrays Butters quite often, however, Butters continues to trust him
                        unconditionally. Despite this, Butters got even in "AWESOM-O", where he filmed Cartman dancing,
                        dressed up as Britney Spears, later showing it to South Park Elementary's various students and
                        faculty.</p>

                    <p>Butters is also a very famous celebrity in the nation of Mexico. In "The Last of the Meheecans",
                        Butters accidentally strays from Cartman's house and almost gets run over by a car. He is then
                        "refuged" in a house by a couple who thinks that Butters is a Mexican and is given the name
                        "Mantequilla", which is Spanish for Butter. They make him into their personal slave and then
                        dump him into an El Pollo Loco restaurant. Butters then goes with some Mexicans and crosses into
                        Mexico where he becomes a symbol of patriotism to the Mexicans. Butters realizes his popularity
                        in Mexico when he comes outside naked in front of hundreds of Mexicans. He realizes that every
                        time he raises his arms, the Mexicans cheer with joy. Butters is then made a fugitive by Cartman
                        but the U.S Border Patrol lets Butters back in and win the game of Texans vs. Mexicans. He is
                        allowed back into the U.S and shows his popularity to the other boys. In addition, he did not
                        get grounded by his parents for becoming famous in a foreign country despite being gone for more
                        than 2 weeks.</p>

                    <h4>Cupid Cartman</h4>

                    <p><i class="character-name">Cupid Cartman</i>, more commonly referred to as "Cupid Me", is an
                        imaginary friend of Eric Cartman,
                        who is the only person who can see him. He first appears in the Season Sixteen episode "Cartman
                        Finds Love".</p>

                        class="image-style-options-1 img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Cupid Cartman image">

                    <p>In "Cartman Finds Love", Cartman, who thinks black people belong together, plans to set up
                        Tolkien and Nichole in a relationship, by having them locked alone in the school gymnasium
                        overnight. After the two are rescued, Cartman secretly watches them, as they decide to pursue
                        the relationship. At that time, Cupid Cartman appears next to Cartman and they congratulate each
                        other.</p>

                    <p>When Tolkien and Nichole break up due to a misunderstanding, Cartman loses faith in Cupid Cartman
                        and beats him with a bat. Later, after watching a laxative commercial, which suggests "you have
                        to push even harder", he decides to apologize to Cupid Cartman and tries to get Tolkien and
                        Nichole back together again. After he succeeds in his plan, Cupid Cartman tells him he found a
                        girl for him too. When asked who she was, Cupid Cartman points to Stacy Muleburg, the Halitosis
                        Kidz! kid, much to Cartman's horror.</p>

                    <p>In "Tweek x Craig", Cartman attempts to use Cupid Cartman to bring Tweek and Craig together.
                        Cupid Cartman goes to Craig and shoots him with an arrow, as well as peeing in his mouth.
                        Afterwards, Cupid Cartman attempts to flirt with Cartman, who denies his advances because he
                        isn't gay.</p>

                    <p>Late in the episode, when Tweek and Craig "break up", Cartman asks Cupid Cartman to make things
                        right again, but he refuses to do so unless Cartman goes on a date with him. Cartman reluctantly
                        agrees and Cupid Cartman shoots Craig's dad with an arrow (and pees in his mouth) to get him to
                        accept Craig's "situation". At the end of the episode, Cupid Cartman gives Cartman a massage on
                        their date, which Cartman doesn't enjoy. He follows this by having anal sex with Cartman. This
                        all happens in Cartman's imagination, though, as in the next scene it is revealed he is actually
                        masturbating in the bathroom, as his mother watches.</p>

                    <h4>Craig Tucker</h4>

                    <img src="/src/img/characters/minor_characters/craig_tucker.webp"
                        class="image-style-options-1 img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Craig Tucker image">

                    <p><i class="character-name">Craig Tucker</i> is a member of the boys' fourth-grade class. Craig's
                        most distinguishing physical
                        feature is his blue chullo hat topped with a yellow puffball. One of his traits is his
                        compulsive tendency to flip people off, usually for no discernible reason. He leads the group
                        known as Craig's Gang. He is one of the two children (along with Tweek Tweak) who are openly
                        gay.</p>

                    <p>While eight years old in the first three seasons, he was nine years old by "Fourth Grade", and as
                        of the Season Twelve episode "Pandemic 2: The Startling", he is ten years old, according to the
                        candles on his birthday cake. He also speaks with a rather deep voice, which is unusual for a
                        child at his age.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Craig seems to be the most stoic, cynical, apathetic, and deadpan kid in South Park, having a
                        more abrasive personality than the rest of the characters, a trait exaggerated by his
                        deeper-than-average voice. He has been described as pragmatic, monotone, and sarcastic. He also
                        appears to be more logical and mature than some of his peers, typically being the one to call
                        them out on their ignorance. He generally prefers to be left alone, harboring very few but
                        simple interests. In the making of South Park: The Fractured But Whole, it was written on a
                        whiteboard that he only cares about his guinea pig, and his boyfriend, Tweek.</p>

                    <p>Craig is implied to have bad behavior, and is referred to as "the biggest trouble-maker" in his
                        class by Eric Cartman in "Tweek vs. Craig". Craig has a habit of flipping people off, sometimes
                        to express irritation, anger, or disdain towards them, sometimes as a reflex. This is a trait
                        the official South Park website states is learned from his family,[3] who are all seen flipping
                        each other off in "Tweek vs. Craig". His habit of flipping people off has been shown much less
                        in later episodes, although a later incident regarding flipping off the principal of school
                        ended up with him in detention, and it is part of one of his abilities in South Park: The
                        Fractured But Whole.</p>

                    <p>The last time in the main series where he is seen making the gesture is "Fun with Veal", where he
                        and his parents are filmed by a cameraman, who gives them an interview. His parents are worried
                        and talk about a serious event that occurs in town, as Craig just remains blank-faced and flips
                        off the people who watch them on TV.</p>

                    <p>Due to his bad behavior, he is frequently sent to Mr. Mackey's office. Scenes involving a
                        character visiting Mr. Mackey's office will often show Craig sitting in the waiting seats
                        outside the door. Craig's most notable interview with Mr. Mackey was in "Rainforest
                        Shmainforest", where he flipped Mr. Mackey off several times and was sent to wait outside the
                        office again.</p>

                    <p>In earlier episodes, Craig normally has a blank face - even when flipping people off. This is
                        seen most predominantly in "Tweek vs. Craig" when he randomly flips off his entire family while
                        remaining a completely straight face. If his face is not blank, he is frowning for one reason or
                        another.</p>

                    <p>Although all the kids are violent, to an extent, Craig is shown to be the second most violent,
                        after Cartman, since he seems to be the primary initiator of several of the more severe
                        incidents of bullying that occurred at the school (e.g. Mark Cotswolds' duct-taping).</p>

                    <p>Craig is also shown to be one of the most skilled fighters in the class, shown beating up Mark
                        Cotswolds, attacking Kyle when Kyle chooses not to dress like a metrosexual, attacking Kenny
                        when Cartman frames him for having lice and beating up several Ginger Kids after Cartman's
                        speech. Contrarily, in "Tweek vs. Craig", he appears to have no idea how to fight at all and has
                        to take lessons in sumo wrestling. He wields a katana in "Good Times with Weapons" as well. And
                        in "Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society", he manages to knock both Tolkien and Butters unconscious
                        before being knocked out by Stan, when he uses a bone as a club to strike him.</p>

                    <img src="/src/img/characters/minor_characters/craig_tucker_2.webp"
                        class="craig-tucker-2-image img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Second Craig Tucker image">

                    <p>Later, his negative traits are subdued, as he is inclined to remain passive and stoical to
                        everything that happens around him. An early expression of this is displayed in "Red Hot
                        Catholic Love", in which he approaches his classmates in the bathroom and asks what was going
                        on. They tell him they are waiting for Cartman to defecate through his mouth. He only answers
                        "Oh" and leaves immediately.</p>

                    <p>During the "Pandemic" episodes, he makes remarks about Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny and their
                        habit of getting into trouble - he even walks away from them when they want to go deeper into an
                        Inca temple. However, at the end of the episode after he accidentally walks on the platform and
                        stopped the "Guinea Pirate", he simply lets out a deep sigh and accepts his fate. Craig never
                        once registers shock or any emotion whatsoever during this - he always says things flatly and
                        monotonously, even when he says "Okay. Now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes."</p>

                    <p>Craig has notable leadership skills, as he is the leader of a gang who is social rivals with
                        Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny. The first appearance of the group is in "Tweek vs. Craig", and
                        they are first acknowledged by the main characters in "How to Eat with Your Butt". The main
                        characters are first shown viewing Craig's gang as rivals in "South Park is Gay!". Cartman
                        refers to the gang as "Craig and those guys". The group usually consists of Craig, Clyde,
                        Tolkien, and sometimes Tweek, Jimmy, or Jason. Craig and Clyde seem to share/alternate in the
                        leadership of their group, although, given their designation, Craig is the primary leader.</p>

                    <p>Another example of Craig's abilities in leadership occurs in "Hooked on Monkey Fonics" when he
                        leads the male students in their plan to harm Mark Cotswolds. The episode also shows that his
                        assertiveness can also lead to bullying.</p>

                    <p>Craig competes more with the main characters than even the rest of his gang (see below). In
                        "Quest for Ratings", he opens a television show in the school entitled "Animals Close-Up With a
                        Wide-Angle Lens", which rivals their news show. However, he seems quite eager to help them at
                        other times, as in "Free Willzyx", in which he is one of the boys trying to get the orca back to
                        its "home" on the moon. Nonetheless, he rarely hangs out with the boys by himself, he is only
                        seen with them when the rest of Craig's gang is there.</p>

                    <p>In "Pandemic", Stan and Kyle's parents decide that they do not want Craig to hang around with
                        them since they had gone missing shortly after he joined the usual quartet. They deem him a
                        "troublemaker", although the Peruvian flute band was the others' idea, and Craig refused to join
                        them until he was told, "don't be an asshole."</p>

                    <p><i class="character-name">Caitlyn Marie Jenner</i>, formerly Bruce Jenner, is a retired American
                        athlete and the 48th Vice
                        President of the United States, serving under Herbert Garrison. She transitioned into a female
                        because of how she felt throughout her life as a man. The main focus of the episode "Stunning
                        and Brave" is how Kyle does not believe she is a hero for coming out as transgender.</p>

                    <p>In "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs", a man who read Butters' book The Poop That Took a Pee,
                        murders the Kardashians, including Bruce Jenner. The book was written by Butters himself and
                        went on to critical acclaim as well as controversy.</p>

                    <p>Caitlyn Jenner was first mentioned in "Stunning and Brave" when PC Principal reprimands and sends
                        Kyle to detention for saying she is not a hero. Later on in the episode, Kyle takes back this
                        statement in desperation to stop Cartman's attack on the PC house and to stop being targeted by
                        PC Principal and Randy Marsh.</p>

                    <p>In "Where My Country Gone?", Kyle meets Jenner during a speech given by Obama celebrating Kyle's
                        newfound tolerance speech. Obama surprises Kyle during the speech, saying that he'll get to ride
                        back to South Park "by his hero." As they leave the White House, Jenner carelessly runs over and
                        kills a pedestrian. At the end of the episode, Mr. Garrison announces his candidacy for
                        president, and announces Caitlyn Jenner as his running mate, meaning that Caitlyn Jenner was a
                        Mr. Garrison supporter. Much like before, she and Garrison drive away, only for her to hit and
                        kill a pedestrian as they leave.</p>

                    <p>Caitlyn reappears in "Sponsored Content" where she aids Mr. Garrison in his debate against
                        Hillary Clinton. She steps in during the debate to say that Hillary looks like a donkey took a
                        shit on her face. After hearing about the conspiracy in South Park, she later drives Mr.
                        Garrison and Principal Victoria back to South Park. Much like before, she winds hitting and
                        killing a pedestrian along the way. This time, she runs over an entire crowd of people.</p>

                    <p>In "Truth and Advertising", they are shocked to see what has happened to the town since they
                        left. She assists Mr. Garrison and Principal Victoria in an attack against the PC Bros.</p>

                        alt="Carol McCormick image">

                    <p>Carol wears a lime-green T-shirt which usually reads "I'm with Stupid", and dark blue jeans. The
                        arrow is supposed to point at Stuart, but she is usually standing on the wrong side of him, so
                        it points off in some other direction. Her hair is red, and similar in style to Red's, but her
                        bangs go in the same direction as Wendy Testaburger's. She has a shadowy patch on her right
                        cheek, which may be a bruise, or simply filth.</p>

                    <p>In "Cartman Joins NAMBLA", her shirt had an American flag embroidered on it, accompanied by the
                        phrase "God Bless". When the McCormick's went on the John Denver experience, however, it
                        appeared as a solid green T-shirt. In "Best Friends Forever", it is a solid, but darker green.
                    </p>

                    <p>For special occasions, she wears a fake fur coat with a red crop top underneath and a red
                        miniskirt, but as of Season Twelve she would wear a dark green blouse and a long gray skirt. At
                        events such as funerals, she wears a much more black fancy shirt and dress with a veil.</p>

                    <p>At night, she wears a nightshirt with several bunnies on it and pajama pants.</p>

                    <p>As of "The Ring", like many other adults, her appearance has been cleaned up, including small
                        subtle changes to her hairstyle, T-shirt, arms and pants. Her arms have been straightened, the
                        shirt is no longer angled, and her hair now has fine detail.</p>

                    <p>In South Park: Post Covid, Carol appears as an elderly woman. She is visibly aged, has gained
                        some weight, and wears a dark green sweater with a large stripe design. Her hair remains similar
                        to the hairstyle she had when she was younger, albeit greying.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>She and her husband Stuart McCormick are prone to excessive drinking, and often fight and bicker
                        with one another. Carol often claims that if Stuart would stop drinking and being lazy, and get
                        a job, they might not be so hungry and poor. Their fighting often escalates to physical beating,
                        and she once gave him a black eye. She seems to have quite some strength, seeing as when she
                        hits Stuart as well as when she tackled Gerald Broflovski to the ground in "I'm a Little Bit
                        Country". Carol does care for Stuart deep down, though, as she was concerned for him when he
                        went ill after consuming a drink mixed with abortion medication, got his nose broken on the John
                        Denver experience, and was molested by the entire NAMBLA Society in "Cartman Joins NAMBLA".</p>

                    <p>However, she also seems to think that the McCormick residence primarily belongs to her, as in
                        "Chickenlover", she says (regarding Stuart): "I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit!
                        He can't even hold a fuckin' job!" and yells a similar phrase at him in "Best Friends Forever".
                        However, Stuart and Gerald built that same house when they were teenagers, as revealed in
                        "Chickenpox".</p>

                    <p>She speaks with a thick Southern accent, a trait passed on to her eldest son.</p>

                    <h4>Christophe</h4>

                    <p><i class="character-name">Christophe</i>, also known as The Mole, is a bitter French nine year
                        old with an expertise in covert
                        operations and an intense hatred of God. He appeared in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.</p>

                        class="image-style-options-1 img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Christophe image">

                    <p>In South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, Gregory told the boys to procure the Mole's help in saving
                        Terrance and Phillip. The Mole helps the boys infiltrate the USO show, but the mission fails
                        after Cartman forgets to shut down the base's security system. As a result, the Mole is fatally
                        injured by a group of army attack dogs.</p>

                    <p>As he died, he sang "The Mole's Reprise", while Kyle held him and softly eased him into death. At
                        his moment of passing away, The Mole continued his pattern of hatred towards God. The Mole, like
                        everyone else who died in the war, was presumably brought back to life after Kenny McCormick's
                        wish to Satan.</p>

                    <p>He made a brief cameo appearance in "Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub", where he is seen on Late Night
                        with Conan O'Brien, while Stan channel surfs.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>The Mole smokes cigarettes, is foul-mouthed, and has an outspoken grudge against God, whom he
                        blames for everything wrong with the world. He displays a tough exterior and appears to have a
                        jaded outlook, as well as being abrasive towards others. He also appears to be manic and
                        emotionally unstable. He also expresses a hatred for guard dogs. His character is influenced by
                        Grantaire from Les Misérables, just as Gregory is similar to Enjolras, although his song, "The
                        Mole's Reprise" also parallels Éponine's "A Little Fall of Rain". Despite his abrasive
                        personality, he still has an immature side to him as shown where he is seen playing with a
                        View-Master using them as binoculars.</p>

                    <h4>Damien Thorn</h4>

                    <p><i class="character-name">Damien Thorn</i> is the son of Satan. He is voiced by Matt Stone, and
                        later by Trey Parker. He claims
                        to be from the seventh layer of hell. His only two speaking appearances to date were in the
                        eponymous episode "Damien" and in South Park: The Stick of Truth.</p>

                    <h6>Background</h6>

                        class="image-style-options-1 img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Damien Thorn image">

                    <p>In "Damien", he joins the boys' class as the new student at South Park Elementary. He introduces
                        himself as the son of Satan, a claim which is completely ignored by Mr. Garrison, despite his
                        obvious evil powers. Damien is rejected from sitting with the main characters during lunch, and
                        is taunted by Kenny and Stan. Outraged, he turns Kenny into a duck-billed platypus, then demands
                        to speak to Jesus.</p>

                    <p>Damien's father, Satan, challenges Jesus to a boxing match, and everyone in town switches their
                        bets to Satan, realizing Jesus doesn't even stand a chance. One bet on Jesus remains, secretly
                        placed by Satan himself. Initially, Jesus is horribly beaten, but Satan throws the fight,
                        allowing Jesus to win in order to get everyone's money. Damien then returns to Hell alongside
                        his father, claiming that he only performs evil because he has to. As Damien leaves, Stan and
                        Kyle briefly lament that he will never be able to gain acceptance because he's always on the
                        move.</p>

                    <p>Since then, Damien has appeared in the background of various episodes. He was also seen in the
                        movie theater with other children watching Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire in South Park:
                        Bigger, Longer & Uncut.</p>

                    <h6>Interactions</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Damien befriends Pip Pirrip after being rejected by Cartman and the others. Though Damien doesn't
                        like Pip, the two are seen together throughout the episode. Pip shows empathy for Damien,
                        claiming that he "knows what it's like being the new kid". Following Pip's advice, Damien goes
                        into counseling with Mr. Mackey, who tells him to be passive and "overly nice". Damien tries
                        this with the boys, but is consequently farted on and called 'Fart Boy'. He tells Pip, who is
                        delighted at the thought of losing that nickname to Damien.</p>

                    <p>Damien and Pip were the only boys not invited to Cartman's birthday party. While sitting on the
                        street, Damien asks Pip if he has always been hated. Pip replies that he has, and that Cartman
                        is also hated, but is accepted by the others for teasing Pip. This gives Damien an idea. Damien
                        takes Pip to Cartman's party and as a gift, sends Pip flying in the air before making him
                        explode. Pip is then seen falling to the ground, where he lands safely in the snow, apparently
                        having enjoyed the experience. This wins Damien's acceptance, and he and Pip are never seen
                        together again.</p>

                    <p><i class="character-name">David Blaine</i> is an American illusionist who first appeared in the
                        Season Five episode "Super Best
                        Friends", where he is the main antagonist.</p>

                    <h6>Background</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>In "Super Best Friends", Seaman explains that David Blaine was raised in New York City by a
                        decent family, but a freak washing machine accident at the age of 12 made him learn the ways of
                        the black arts. His magic is a combination of centrifugal line and sleight of hand.</p>

                    <p>He is the leader of the suicide cult religion, "Blaintology" who views his magic tricks as holy
                        "miracles". He considers himself God, but the Super Best Friends halt the suicides and destroy
                        Blaine's giant Abraham Lincoln statue with their own giant John Wilkes Booth statue. Blaine
                        escapes with a jet.</p>

                    <p>Blaine appears again in the Season Seven episode, "Krazy Kripples", as a member of Christopher
                        Reeve's Legion of Doom. His most recent appearance was in the episode "201", as one of the

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Blaine is an evil, diabolical and power-hungry individual, who revels in the dark arts and
                        manipulates gullible individuals into following his suicidal death cult. He has a callous and
                        cruel disregard regard for the lives of his members, who he is willing to sacrifice on a mass
                        scale, in order for him to take over the world as a supervillain. He is also extremely
                        narcissistic and suffers from a God-complex, believing his magic tricks and spells to be "holy
                        miracles" and envisions himself as a messiah of sorts.</p>

                    <p><i class="character-name">Ms. Diane Choksondik</i> was a fourth-grade elementary teacher who was
                        first introduced in the Season
                        Four episode "Fourth Grade". Her name is a play on the phrase, "chokes on dick". She was the
                        fourth-grade teacher at South Park Elementary until her death in "The Simpsons Already Did It"
                        (her death was spoiled in the previous episode).</p>

                    <p>In "Fourth Grade", Ms. Choksondik is first introduced as the school's new fourth grade teacher,
                        the same year the boys are scheduled to attend the fourth grade. The boys and their classmates
                        initially plan to collectively moon her to assert dominance, but she proves intimidating,
                        leading all but Eric Cartman to back out of the ruse.</p>

                    <p>She complains to the school staff that her children are undisciplined, but they are horrified by
                        her appearance. She asks to speak to their previous teacher, but they inform her that Mr.
                        Garrison is living somewhere out in the mountains as a result of his denial of his
                        homosexuality.</p>

                    <p>She nonetheless seeks Garrison out and he trains her and advises her on how to deal with the
                        children, while coming to terms with his own sexuality. She returns to the school and uses what
                        she has learned, advising the boys to "present them" when they tell her to suck their balls,
                        just as Garrison suggested.</p>

                    <h6>Death</h6>

                    <p>The episode "Professor Chaos" ended on a cliffhanger (though it was revealed in the same episode)
                        saying someone would die, in a parody of cliffhanger endings. It was revealed during this gag
                        that Ms. Choksondik had died. In the following episode, "The Simpsons Already Did It", the boys
                        had put some of their Sea People, brine shrimp, in her coffee as a joke.</p>

                    <p>They went to find their Sea People, to avoid getting caught, and Cartman hid inside her cadaver
                        to avoid being discovered by the mortuary staff. It was revealed in this episode when the boys
                        were watching the news that Mr. Mackey's semen was found in her stomach, but that did not
                        contribute to her death.</p>

                    <p>Her real cause of death is said to be unknown. However, this might be a mystification, since one
                        can easily deduce from the episode. Full explanation here.</p>

                    <p>After this incident, the students in Ms. Choksondik's class were given two weeks off school until
                        Mr. Mackey taught for a short period. In the episode "The Death Camp of Tolerance", Mr. Garrison
                        reprised his role as their teacher until he got fired again in "Where My Country Gone?".</p>

                    <h6>Appearance</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Ms. Choksondik is well known for her distinctive appearance; she has extremely exaggerated saggy
                        breasts, is overweight, and her right eye is lazy, causing it to drift downwards or wobble
                        around as she talks. She also does not wear a bra, so when she lifts her arm up, her shirt
                        stretches going up with it revealing her nipples. She also wears large glasses and was made fun
                        of in high school because of them.</p>

                    <p>Her outfit consists of a long red V-necked top with white cuffs and a white trim on the hem, and
                        a calf-length blue skirt that is possibly made of denim. She keeps her hair in a loose ponytail
                        held in place with a large white hair-tie and small golden loop earrings. She has a side fringe,
                        which is usually tucked behind her left ear (in fact, the only time it is seen loose is in
                        "Proper Condom Use" when she is having sex with Mr. Mackey). Also in "Proper Condom Use", she is
                        shown to be wearing large purple underpants with a frilly hem (the outline of which shows
                        through her skirt when she bends down). She has plain black shoes and appears to be wearing
                        white socks or tights, but when Mr. Mackey removes her clothes during "Proper Condom Use" it
                        appears that she is not wearing anything on her feet. However, this may be a continuity error.

                    <p>Early in life, Shwaggins was frequently teased for being short in stature. His mother had
                        dwarfism and his father had "gigantism", and she believed the two would produce a child of
                        average height.</p>

                        to identifying users online. He then escorts Gerald to an undisclosed location, where a meeting
                        of fellow trolls, including Jenkins, is taking place.</p>

                    <p>In "Douche and a Danish", the meeting takes place, and Shwaggins successfully convinces Gerald
                        Broflovski to join their cause. Preparing for the big troll against Denmark, Shwaggins partners
                        with Broflovski at his home and sets up his computer in Gerald's office. The two, along with all
                        of the other trolls, successfully troll Denmark.</p>

                    <p>Believing he had a friendship with Gerald, he tries many unsuccessful times to grow their
                        friendship in "Fort Collins". He writes a song for Gerald, and even brings him a present. To no
                        avail, he finally learns that Gerald trolls just to be offensive, and gives up. Having given up,
                        he is unresponsive when Gerald attempts to contact him.</p>

                    <p>In "Oh, Jeez", he appears briefly along with the other trolls captured by TrollTrace.com.
                        Believing that Hillary Clinton had hired him to infiltrate and sabotage the service, he tours
                        the building in disguise. Lennart Bedrager secretly had a deal with Clinton to capture the
                        trolls, and locks Shwaggins and other trolls in a secure room.</p>

                    <p>Still captured in "Members Only", he tries to convince Gerald to stop trying to escape through
                        the security door. After Lennart Bedrager announces his plan for the world, Shwaggins declares
                        that President Garrison will not allow him to follow through with his plan.</p>

                    <h4>Dougie O'Connell</h4>

                    <p><i class="character-name">Dougie O'Connell</i> is a 2nd Grade student at South Park Elementary.
                        He made his debut appearance in
                        the Season Three episode, "Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub", where he was seen playing with Butters
                        Stotch, Pip Pirrip, and to a lesser extent, Stan Marsh. Originally in first grade, he advanced
                        to the second grade in the Season Four episode, "Fourth Grade". He often appears as Professor
                        Chaos' sidekick, General Disarray.</p>

                    <p>Dougie, Pip, Butters, and Stan are at Mr. Mackey's meteor shower party in "Two Guys Naked in a
                        Hot Tub". Much to Stan's chagrin, the former three start playing 'Wickershams and Ducklers'.
                        Dougie calls Stan a sourpuss for not joining in.</p>

                    <p>Moving on to playing Charlie's Angels, the four boys embark on a mission to leave the room
                        through an air vent Dougie finds. After their next mission, they watch a news report about the
                        ATF raiding Mackey's house. Dougie makes a video and Butters delivers it to a reporter, defusing
                        the situation.</p>

                    <p>In "Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000", Dougie is sledding at school with Pip, Tolkien, and Clyde.
                        Shortly after this, in "Fourth Grade", Dougie advanced from the first grade to the second grade.
                    </p>

                    <p>Butters is fired as the boys' fourth friend and becomes Professor Chaos in the eponymous episode.
                        Dougie joins the group of candidates auditioning to fill the role but is quickly eliminated
                        without having a proper chance.</p>

                    <p>He then learns of Butters' secret identity and becomes his sidekick as General Disarray. The two
                        try, unsuccessfully, to "destroy" the world by flooding it with a garden hose and by destroying
                        the ozone layer with aerosol spray cans.</p>

                    <p>In the episode "Professor Chaos", Dougie auditions to be the new fourth friend of the main
                        characters. He fails, though, and decides that he is an outcast. After discovering Butters'
                        secret alter-ego, Professor Chaos, he requests to join Butters in his attempts at world
                        demolition. Butters agrees, and dubs Dougie, "General Disarray". Their plots of flooding the
                        world with a garden hose, and then destroying the ozone layer with cans of aerosol spray
                        ultimately fail. Butters then tries to come up with various ideas, but Dougie tells him each
                        time that the Simpsons already did them.</p>

                    <p>Dougie often shows more willingness than Butters to go through with his "evil" plans when in his
                        alter-ego. This is showcased in the episode "The Coon", where he suggests betraying The Coon by
                        blowing him up alongside a hospital.</p>

                        and Hall of Famer who appears in "W.T.F.".</p>

                    <h6>Background</h6>

                    <p>He is seen in a WWE wrestling match versing his opponent, John Cena, at first he is arguing with
                        Cena to build tension for the fight. Cena then says how he slept with Vanessa last night, and
                        Edge also mentions how he also took his belt and his job, Edge then punches Cena, and the two
                        begin wrestling.</p>

                        black boots, this is a reference to his nickname 'The Rated-R Superstar'. His pants have a black
                        and gray pattern on them. He also wears black wristbands on each of his arms, with two
                        wristbands surrounding his wrist, and the others surrounding his elbows. The microphone he is
                        holding is based on the type of microphone they used on WWE Television back in 2009 when the
                        episode first aired with the logo similar to the then WWE logo.</p>

                        who appeared as a ghost in the
                        Season Seventeen episode, "Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers", although he was referenced in the
                        Season Seven episode, "Raisins", when he appeared on Stan Marsh's shirt, as he had temporarily
                        turned goth.</p>

                        "poser". In the car, on the way to stop the emos, he states that his "goth name" is Nightpain,
                        thus identifying himself as a goth. After helping to infiltrate Troubled Acres, Poe abandons the
                        group, instead choosing to drink coffee at the Village Inn. However, he does eventually return
                        to reveal that the "emo plants" are actually just regular ficus plants from Lowe's Home and

                    <p><i class="character-name">Elin Nordegren</i> is the Swedish-born ex-wife of Tiger Woods. She
                        appears in the Season Fourteen
                        episode, "Sexual Healing".</p>

                    <p>In the episode "Sexual Healing", Elin primarily appears as a video game character in Tiger Woods
                        PGA Tour 11 for Xbox 360, which is not so much a golf game as a two-player fighting game. In the
                        game, Elin goes around beating Tiger with a golf club for his many infidelities in assorted
                        venues such as their house, the golf course, and news conferences. The game is highly popular
                        among the boys, who find it far more entertaining than actual golf games.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the episode, numerous men, including Tiger Woods, attempt to make the claim that they
                        are not responsible for their sexual behavior, but rather that it's caused by something outside
                        their control, such as addiction. She later appears with Tiger during his press conference in
                        which he claims that he is 'cured' of his sex addiction (thanks to the death of the "Wizard
                        Alien" responsible), and that she now has no reason to get revenge on him by having affairs with
                        numerous other men.</p>

                    <p>She gives him a shifty-eyed look, which implies she still plans to, or already has. Apparently,
                        with Tiger now behaving himself, her character avatar is removed from the game, making it a
                        boring golf game once again.</p>

                    <h6>Relationships</h6>

                    <p>Strained. After Elin finds out about Tiger Woods receiving a text message from "some low-life
                        hooker" on Thanksgiving, she goes on a rampage, chasing him around the house with a golf club.
                        After Tiger Woods announced his having been "cured" of sexual addiction and his forthcoming
                        return to golf, it appeared that they were reconciled, though probably only in public. It should
                        be noted that in real-life, Elin divorced Woods in August 2010, several months after "Sexual
                        Healing" aired.</p>

                <div id="father_maxi">

                    <h4>Father Maxi</h4>

                    <p><i class="character-name">Father Maxi</i> is a Roman Catholic priest who serves as the mouthpiece
                        for South Park's Christian
                        community. He is voiced by Matt Stone and runs the South Park Church. He first appears in the
                        Season One episode, "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo".</p>

                    <h6>Background</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <img src="/src/img/characters/minor_characters/father_maxi_current.webp"
                        class="image-style-options-1 img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Father Maxi image">

                    <p>Father Maxi's unwavering belief that everyone is going to Hell goes so far as that he bluntly
                        claims that Timmy Burch would go to Hell since Timmy cannot confess his sins, as he cannot speak
                        anything fluently.</p>

                    <p>However, at times Father Maxi can come off as less of a fundamentalist, as in "Red Hot Catholic
                        Love" in which he grows concerned by the massive amounts of sexual abuse cases regarding priests
                        and children and is horrified to discover that sex with children is apparently part of Vatican
                        Law. When he discovers this, he makes several attempts to change the "Holy Doctrine" so that sex
                        with children is wrong and suggests that priests be allowed to have sex with women.</p>

                    <p>His desire to change Vatican Law and be allowed to sleep with women may have something to do with
                        the fact that he has apparently had sex with several women in South Park, including Liane
                        Cartman.</p>

                    <p>There are also times where he seems to know very little about religion; once, when seeing Jesus
                        Christ, he exclaimed "Hey, it's that guy from the public access show!" However, considering that
                        Jesus actually hosts a cable access show in South Park, this is most likely done for irony
                        purposes.</p>

                    <blockquote class="episodes-title">Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo</blockquote>
                    <p>When it's announced that Jesus has been removed from the Christmas play, he requests that Santa
                        Claus and Frosty be removed as well.</p>

                    <blockquote class="episodes-title">Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?</blockquote>
                    <p>He has his first major role in this episode. He expresses his beliefs on whether or not the
                        handicapped will go to Hell to the boys. They later see him having sex with a woman in the
                        church confessional, which gives Cartman the idea to lead his own Christian community.</p>

                    <blockquote class="episodes-title">Cripple Fight</blockquote>
                    <p>Father Maxi claims he will be able to convert Big Gay Al to in being straight but it is revealed
                        he made a similar claim about a man called "Peterson" who Father Maxi himself ended up having
                        sex with.</p>

                    <blockquote class="episodes-title">Red Hot Catholic Love</blockquote>
                    <p>Despite his character flaws, it was Father Maxi who, in the episode "Red Hot Catholic Love",
                        unearthed the massive corruption behind the many church-related sexual assaults. He also forced
                        the Catholic Church to stop letting priests molest young boys. Apparently, this plan almost
                        succeeds.</p>

                    <blockquote class="episodes-title">A Boy And A Priest</blockquote>
                    <p>Father Maxi temporarily closes the church and becomes friends with Butters after the churchgoers
                        heckle him with pedophilia jokes. After Butters takes Maxi to Clyde's birthday party and the
                        children refuse to accept Maxi's presence, Maxi cuts ties with Butters, explaining he feels
                        guilt for knowing the Catholic Church were doing terrible things to boys and doing nothing about
                        it. However, when the Catholic Cleanup Crew kidnaps Butters, Stan, and Clyde, Maxi goes to save
                        them. The crew offers to transfer him, but Maxi runs them over with a "Kumboni" as he realizes
                        his purpose is defending the boys. He then returns to the church and preaches about penance
                        despite the continuing pedophilia jokes.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>His personality seems somewhat flexible based on the needs of the show; often he is a
                        narrow-minded and intolerant man who is convinced most people are going to be damned to Hell,
                        often for trivial offenses. For example, in "Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?" he states
                        constantly through his sermons that Hell awaits everyone in the town who does not go to church
                        and confess their sins.</p>

                    <p>Father Maxi is rude and disrespectful towards the beliefs of others, such as he when he tricks
                        Kyle, who is Jewish, into helping Stan and Cartman, into doing the Stations of the Cross. Also
                        in "Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?", he informs Kyle that because of his beliefs, he and his
                        family will go to Hell without question.</p>

                    <p>However, he still attempts to be a good priest and leader of the community. In "Red Hot Catholic
                        Love", it's revealed that he's the only priest not engaging in pedophilia. As a result, he
                        points out that they are to spread the word of God, not harm the innocent. He even goes to
                        Vatican City to stop this and nearly brings down the church as a result.</p>

                    <p>Firkle says that most people are "Nazi conformist cheerleaders", and that he is the biggest
                        non-conformist there is. In "Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers", Firkle turns on the other goth
                        kids and reveals that he was in on the plot to turn people "emo" with plants. Later, it is
                        discovered that the plants were fake. He was shocked that he betrayed his friends for nothing.
                        He was likely readmitted back into the group; he is still seen with the other Goth Kids in
                        subsequent appearances.</p>

                    <h6>Criminal Record</h6>

                    <li>Arson: In "The Ungroundable", he set fire to the South Park Hot Topic store, burning it to bits
                        and pieces.</li>

                    <li>Attempted murder: Firkle attempts to kill Mysterion in "Mysterion Rises", but the Cult Leader
                        does so instead.</li>

                    <li>Attempted murder/kidnapping: In "The Ungroundable", he, along with the Goths, kidnaps Mike
                        Makowski, the leader of the South Park Vampire Society, with the intent of murdering him.
                        However, they change their minds after he admits he is not a vampire and ship him off to
                        Scottsdale, Arizona instead.</li>

                    <li>Drug abuse/underage smoking: The Goth Kids are frequently seen smoking cigarettes despite their
                        ages (5-11), in addition to abusing cough syrup to hallucinate.</li>

                    <li>Treason/sedition: In the Superhero Arc, the Goths are shown to be part of the Cthulhu cult and
                        supporting the eponymous monster's reign of terror. They later leave the cult, though,

                    <li>Violation of firearm laws/threatening with a deadly weapon: In Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers,
                        Firkle threatens Michael, Mike, and Pete with a gun. Because he is no older than six, it is
                        illegal for him to have this weapon.</li>

                    <p>He is referred to as a midget in "The Ungroundable" by an unknown student when wearing regular
                        clothes. He has short, soft black hair with a long side-swept fringe parted to the right, wears
                        dark purple lipstick and black eyeliner. He wears a black trench coat, black pants, and black
                        shoes.</p>

                    <p>As a conformist in "The Ungroundable", he wore a turquoise dress-shirt, khaki pants, and gray
                        shoes with a white stripe each.</p>

                    <p>During the Attack the School quest in South Park: The Stick of Truth, he dresses up as a Viking.
                        He wears a brown Viking helmet (more different than Michael's and appears heavy), and a
                        green-silked cape.</p>

                    <p>When he reveals himself as an actual Emo in "Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers", the hair he had on
                        was just a toupee. He had his actual hair dyed magenta at the ends with a smaller fringe, a
                        dark-gray t-shirt with a gray skull and polka-dots, and some colorful bracelets.</p>

                    <p>In South Park: Post Covid, Firkle appears as an adult man, and is radically different from his
                        past form. Firkle seemingly was stopped adding make up to make his skin pale, because it its now
                        the most natural shade of the Goth Kids. In addition he still has a similar hair but with an
                        under buzzcut. He also has tear-like eye shadow, a brow piercing, sunken cheeks, and seemingly
                        has tattoos on his arms.</p>

                        with the purpose of

                    <p>Funnybot appears in the episode of the same name, in which he served as the main antagonist.
                        After exhausting standard comedy routines, Funnybot decided to start slaughtering audiences to

                        Six episode, "My Future Self

                        drugs and alcohol. However, Butters found out that he was being deceived, with the help of Stan
                        Marsh.</p>

                    <h6>Background</h6>

                    <p>Future Butters came to the Stotch Residence four months before Stan's future self, Future Stan
                        did. Future Butters tells his family about how he abused alcohol, and now must take a medicine
                        to prevent liver failure. He also frequently watches a show called "Becker", much to the disdain
                        of Butters.</p>

                    <p>Stan begins to put the pieces together when Butters tells him about Future Butters' coming. He
                        exclaims to Butters that their parents have been lying to them and should be punished. The next
                        day, both boys follow an address to a parental revenge business they had found in a newspaper
                        ad. Upon arrival, they find out the business is run solely by Eric Cartman.</p>

                    <p>Though their decision tentative, Stan and Butters agree to consult Eric for ideas. Eric gets
                        Butters to agree with smearing his home's walls in fecal matter, but Stan chooses to leave when
                        Eric doesn't offer a satisfactory punishment. After Butters' parents, Stephen and Linda Stotch,
                        come back home with Future Butters, the redecoration makes them realize their mistakes and
                        confess their lies to their son.</p>

                    <p>True to his role, he appears to be an older but a slovenly version of Butters. He has a tuft of
                        unkempt blonde hair, a turquoise T-shirt, and dark green pants. The major contrasting points in
                        appearance to Butters, other than the obvious age difference, is his five o'clock shadow, pot
                        belly, and blond eyebrows.</p>

                        appears in the episode "My Future
                        Self n' Me". His goal was to act as if he was from a future in which Stan Marsh was addicted to
                        drugs in order to dissuade Stan from getting involved in drugs. The plan completely failed as
                        Stan quickly found out that Future Stan was actually an actor.</p>

                    <h6>Background</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>In the supposed future painted by "Future Stan", after touching one marijuana joint, Stan's life
                        spiraled down into a self-destructive series of events in which he became hooked on assorted
                        drugs. He eventually ended up being sent to Juvenile Hall, during which he lost contact with his
                        childhood friends. He would later be released and spend the rest of his life living on the
                        streets, doing assorted and unspeakable things for drugs and booze. One night after falling
                        asleep behind a crack-house, he got stuck in a time-matrix and was transported back into his own
                        childhood. The Marsh family took him in upon his arrival.</p>

                    <p>In truth, "Future Stan" was nothing more than a professional stage actor associated with
                        Motivation Corp., a company created by people who felt that, rather than speak honestly with
                        kids about drugs, sex and other vices, parents could instead manipulate them with supposedly
                        dismal futures involving time-travel. Randy and Sharon hired Motivation Corp in hopes of doing
                        this with Stan. Determined to keep the lie going, Randy went as far as to cut off "Future
                        Stan's" hand when Stan pretended to cut his own hand off, possibly killing him.</p>

                    <p>Future Stan clearly looks like he's been living on the streets and has been addicted to drugs. He
                        has long brown tattered hair, a black five o-clock shadow, brown eyebrows, and is slightly
                        overweight. He wears similar clothes to Stan. He wears blue pants, a light blue shirt, and
                        Stan's trademark red poof-ball hat. As of the end of "My Future Self n' Me", Future Stan's actor
                        is missing a hand due to Randy calling Stan's bluff.</p>

                        appears in the Season Seven
                        episode, "All About Mormons".</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Gary's personality appears to be shaped largely by his family and religion, Mormonism. He is
                        friendly, outgoing, and optimistic. When he is teased and bullied by other students at school,
                        he does not appear to be bothered by it. For example, in "All About Mormons", Eric Cartman
                        introduces himself to Gary as "Ura Fag." Rather than acting upset or embarrassed, Gary laughs.
                        Later, when Stan threatens to “kick [his] ass,” Gary promises not to fight back and even hopes
                        that they can be friends someday.</p>

                    <p>Although he is friendly and forgiving, Gary is not a pushover. When Stan refuses to be Gary's
                        friend because of his religion, Gary responds with a very thoughtful speech about how proud he
                        is to be Mormon and what it has done for him. The speech ends with: "All I ever did was try to
                        be your friend, Stan. But you were so high and mighty that you couldn't just look past my
                        religion and be my friend back. You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls."</p>

                    <p>He wears a magenta yarmulke, a khaki jacket with a blue shirt underneath as well as forest green
                        trousers. He has brown hair with sideburns and a full beard trimmed into a point at the chin and
                        shaved alongside the lips so that his mustache does not connect. On special occasions he is seen
                        wearing a variant of his casual clothes but they instead consist of several different tones of
                        black.</p>

                    <p>He has never been seen without his yarmulke on, except in "Major Boobage" which confirms that he
                        is balding, and in "Insecurity" where he is wearing a UPS driver cap instead of a yarmulke. The
                        fact that he is always seen wearing it would imply that he practices Orthodox Judaism, yet his
                        liberal views and the fact that no other Jewish clothes are worn by him or his family implies
                        that he is conservative or a member of a more progressive sect who wears it by choice.</p>

                    <p>He has been shown to have abundant chest hair; however, two hairless areas can be seen on it, one
                        on each chest, presumably being the result of his sexual encounters with Sheila.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Gerald seems to care about the environment and current events. He is typically portrayed to be
                        kind and friendly, though he can be stubborn, sarcastic and impolite at times. Although he is
                        seen as a primarily moral man, he is seen to get carried away with matters of money, which shows
                        him to be corruptible, tempting him to do things he would normally find amoral and wrong, much
                        to his shame.</p>

                    <p>In Season Twenty, his corruptible side is shown as he is revealed to be the infamous internet
                        troll known as Skankhunt42. He gleefully posts lewd and abysmal comments to young girls, and
                        women in general. He was visibly shocked when his trolling caused Freja Ollegard to commit
                        suicide, showing that he had no intentions of killing people. The source of this is that he
                        likes to harass just for the pleasure of humiliating others and to feel when he used to bully as
                        a kid.</p>

                    <h6>Trivia</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <li>With the exception of "Major Boobage", Gerald is always shown wearing his yarmulke hat, even
                        when he's otherwise completely naked like in "Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub" and "Not Funny".</li>

                    <li>Despite being named after Matt Stone's father, Gerald is not largely based on him. While Stone's
                        mother is Jewish, his father is a gentile of Irish descent, and Stone says they raised him in an
                        agnostic household. Stone decided to portray the character of Gerald as recognizably Jewish,
                        stating that doing so "creates more opportunity for comedy".</li>

                    <p>In Gordon's first appearance in "Ginger Kids", he is among several discriminated redheads
                        participating in Cartman's pro-ginger rally. He plays a significant role throughout the episode,
                        being seen as a prominent follower of Cartman in the rally and giving a short talk at the
                        Airport Hilton before introducing Cartman to the gingers. In the end, when the gingers are about
                        to kill the non-redheaded kids, he is suspicious of Cartman's quick decision to change his plan
                        after seeing Kyle saying something privately to him. In this appearance, he is referred to as
                        "Jody".</p>

                    <p>The character was later used in "Fatbeard", where he is first seen reading the morning
                        announcements before being interrupted by Cartman and later getting kicked out of Cartman's
                        pirate crew for being red-haired.</p>

                    <p>Gordon makes his final appearance in "Dances with Smurfs", where he is gunned down during the
                        morning announcements by a man who mistakes him for a 40-year-old truck driver, who is having an
                        affair with his wife. This ends up causing the school body to do a memorial service for him and
                        ask for someone to replace him.</p>

                    <p>Despite Gordon's death, his character is still used as a prop in the crowd of gingers in "201".

                    <p><i class="character-name">George Lucas</i> is the creator of the Star Wars franchise and the
                        producer and writer of the Indiana
                        Jones movies.</p>

                    <p>George and Steven Spielberg seem to care more about changing their movies with new technology
                        over what the fans want in the original films.</p>

                    <p>George is portrayed as a rapist of his past in "Free Hat" by destroying his movies with updated
                        edits. Although when confronted by the boys, he is almost convinced to give up re-working his
                        movies, until Spielberg comes in and arrests the children.</p>

                    <p>In the episode, "The China Probrem", Lucas and Steven release their latest collaboration, Indiana
                        Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The general public is horrified by the film, feeling
                        that Lucas and Spielberg raped their beloved character, Indiana Jones. As a result, the boys
                        file a lawsuit against Lucas and Spielberg for "class-1 rape". When the police arrive to arrest
                        them, they find Lucas and Spielberg gang-raping a Star Wars Stormtr ooper, and later inform the
                        boys that they found the dead, raped bodies of Yoda and Short Round.</p>

                    <h6>Trivia</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <li>While "Free Hat" portrays Spielberg as the mastermind behind the edits, with Lucas reluctantly
                        going along, in real life, the two directors' attitudes ended up being the other way around.
                        Steven Spielberg later stated that editing E.T. was a huge mistake and vowed never to do such a
                        thing again, while Lucas has seen numerous edits made to the original trilogy since this episode
                        and has stated more may well occur.</li>

                    <li>George was redesigned for "The China Probrem".</li>

                    <li>The relationship between George Lucas and Steven Spielberg resembles Anakin Skywalker and Darth
                        Sidious from Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.</li>
