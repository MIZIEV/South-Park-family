                        class="al-gore-image img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Al Gore image">

                    <p>Al Gore was the 45th Vice President of the United States under the Clinton administration from
                        1993 until 2001, and ran for president against George Bush in 2000. He is most notable within
                        the series for trying to alert people of ManBearPig, though he also appears once during his vice
                        presidency, and reappears later to sue the town.</p>

                    <h6>Appearance</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Al Gore originally wore a generic black suit with a thin face and black hair. In Season Ten, his
                        new look included dark brown hair, a blueish gray shirt, and a brown tie. He later began wearing
                        a red cape. In Season Twenty-Two, his look has changed again, with his hair color now gray and
                        having grown a matching beard. He also wears his blueish gray shirt, dark pants, and bowling
                        shoes.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>

                    <hr />
                    <p>Gore appears to be very delusional and deranged, which is shown most when he apparently invents
                        the ManBearPig creature and puts the boys' lives in danger to maintain that fantasy. This might
                        be due to an obsessive need for everyone to admire him as per Stan's description, "You just use
                        ManBearPig to get attention for yourself because you're a loser!". This indicates that Gore has
                        an extreme case of egocentricity as his attention-seeking idée fixe has poisoned his mind to the
                        point that he undisputedly believes in the reality of ManBearPig.</p>

                    <p>Gore apparently made up ManBearPig and made it seem real (as far as he thought), so that the
                        world would consider him a hero for "destroying" it, which is all he cares about. His mental
                        creation manifested itself among the other evil characters of Imaginationland and he was willing
                        to destroy Imaginationland along with all of its inhabitants to kill ManBearPig. Believing
                        himself a super-hero of sorts, after donning his cape he began running around acting and talking
                        like Superman. However, ManBearPig was proven to be real in "Time To Get Cereal" where it goes
                        on a rampage in South Park.</p>

                    <h4>Aslan the Lion</h4>

                    <img src="/src/img/characters/minor_characters/aslan.webp" class="aslan-image img-thumbnail rounded"
                        alt="Aslan the Lion image">

                    <p>Aslan the Lion is a character from The Chronicles of Narnia. In South Park, he appears as the
                        leader of the Council of Nine in the "Imaginationland" trilogy, as well as the leader of the
                        lions at the zoo in "Here Comes the Neighborhood". In "Imaginationland", he scares Butters
                        Stotch into using his "Key" powers to revive Santa Claus, and later other good characters, so
                        the good creatures could defeat the evil characters.</p>

                    <h6>Appearance</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>In "Here Comes the Neighborhood", he looks like a regular lion, with brown fur and a large mane.
                        However, in "Imaginationland", he appears more realistic and has green emerald eyes.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>In "Here Comes the Neighborhood", he seems to have a huge sense of humor, even laughing at every
                        joke he hears. In "Imaginationland", his sense of humor is largely gone, replaced by a more
                        serious, commanding attitude.</p>

                    <h4>Asian girls</h4>

                    <p>The Asian Girls are a clique of new students at South Park Elementary who are usually seen
                        sitting on the steps just inside the main entrance to the school, drawing art, particularly
                        Yaoi. They were formally introduced in the Season Nineteen episode, "Tweek x Craig", but a few
                        of them are also seen in "Safe Space". They have since become background characters.</p>

                    <p>There are other Asian-American female students at the school, such as Liza Nelson, who are not
                        considered part of his clique.</p>

                    <h6>Background</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>The Asian Girls are a specific clique consisting of several girls with at least Japanese, Korean,
                        and Chinese heritage, including Lisa Akimoto, Kelly Zhou and Heather Nishimura. They tend to be
                        quiet and keep to themselves, responding to outside events through their art rather than direct
                        action, and sometimes conversing in their native dialects. They all appear to be artists. Many
                        of them also sell their works to others behind Whole Foods in CtPaTown.</p>

                    <p>During "Tweek x Craig", the Asian Girls draw pictures of Tweek and Craig together in a fictitious
                        homosexual relationship, starting a rumor that the two are dating. Wendy Testaburger holds a
                        presentation for the school featuring their art, drawing much attention to them and the rumor,
                        and they are also seen selling their art in CtPaTown. When Tweek and Craig "break up," The Asian
                        girls draw more depressed art to reflect the way the town feels.</p>

                    <p>Baahir Hassan Abdul Hakeem is a male fourth grader at South Park Elementary, who appears in the
                        Season Eleven episode, "The Snuke".</p>

                    <p>Baahir has olive skin and curly, black hair, that is shaved around the sides. He wears a
                        sky-blue, button-up shirt and dark gray trousers.</p>

                    <p>He was portrayed as nice and slightly over-trusting, even befriending Butters Stotch and going to
                        his house, despite only knowing Butters for a few hours.</p>
                    <p>Baahir's parents, Mr. Hakeem and Mrs. Hakeem, were kidnapped by Cartman when he was trying to
                        find out the location of their son. He then tortured them by farting in their faces. When they
                        refused to respond, professing that they did not know where Baahir was, Cartman then injected
                        his arm with a syringe full of apple juice, warning them that apple juice gives him "super bad
                        farts". He left them tied up and imprisoned after he found out that Baahir was at Butters'
                        house. Due to their abominable experiences in South Park, the Hakeems moved away at the end of
                        the episode. Cartman rejoiced at this, saying that not only did his bigotry save the country
                        from the real terrorist attacks, but it also got rid of the Muslim family.</p>

                    <p>They were unable to accomplish this task. Instead, Randy tells Stan to stab Baby Fark McGeezax
                        with the shank in the neck. Stan reluctantly complied, and stabs Baby Fark McGeezax, presumably
                        killing him.</p>

                    <p>The space outlaw was revealed to be an ambassador to new world testing, named Kevern Zaksor and
                        the entire chain of events was a test to see if Earth was worthy of joining the intergalactic

                    <p>In "Follow That Egg!", it was revealed that Big Gay Al had started up a relationship with Mr.

                        latter's sex change operation, and that Slave and Al had moved in together. Garrison, who had

                        were instead using the term "Fag" in regards to the Harley Riders, stating "You can be gay, and
                        not a fag". Al and Slave, finding agreement with this, help the boys to change the definition of
                        "faggot" from a gay person to an annoying Harley rider, with Al presiding over meetings in town

                    <p>Leopold "Butters" Stotch is a major character in the series. He is a fourth-grader in South Park
                        Elementary. Butters' role gradually began to increase after he replaced Kenny during his
                        temporary removal in Season Six. This allowed Butters to gain more screen time and further
                        develop his character. He is the "innocent child" in the group and Cartman's most exploited and
                        possibly best "friend". Butters is loosely based on Eric Stough, an animation director/producer
                        that works on the show.</p>

                    <h6>Background</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Butters has made appearances since "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", though initially as a background
                        character. He gets his first speaking role in the Season Two episode, "Clubhouses". He later
                        receives a speaking role in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.</p>

                    <p>Butters was seen sporadically in seasons three through five, going from a social pariah in "Two
                        Guys Naked in a Hot Tub" to mean-spirited bully in "Hooked on Monkey Fonics".</p>

                    <p>In "Jared Has Aides", Butters was adopted by Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Eric Cartman as
                        their fourth friend when Kenny McCormick died "permanently" at the end of the fifth season. The
                        writers had given Butters his own spotlight episode as the season five finale to prepare fans
                        for Butters taking Kenny's place on the show. The episode, titled "Butters' Very Own Episode",
                        gave Butters a complicated back story where his father was outed as being a closet bisexual and
                        his mother attempted to drown her son Butters in a fit of madness. They all made up at the end
                        of the episode and nothing came of it.</p>

                    <p>Butters found himself as the new fourth friend, being put down and treated like a total outcast
                        by his new friends. Kyle, Stan, and Cartman all openly bullied Butters, telling him how he is
                        not cool like Kenny. Cartman in particular took perverse pleasure in making Butters suffer, to
                        the extent that, in "Jared Has Aides", he pretended to be Butters on the phone and bad-mouthed
                        his parents, just so he could watch them abusing him. Several instances show the boys having
                        Butters dress up as Kenny or simply call him Kenny or Not-Kenny, possibly to cope with their
                        loss.</p>

                    <p>Butters would remain on as the fourth member of the gang for four more episodes; two of the
                        episodes continued the plot of Butters being abused but downplayed it and in the case of "Freak
                        Strike", ending the episode just as Butters was about to be beaten (with Cartman being beaten up
                        instead). Ultimately, in the sixth episode of season six, "Professor Chaos", Butters is expelled
                        from the group for being "too lame" and adopts his super-villain alter ego "Professor Chaos" as
                        a means to get revenge against the group and society for rejecting him. Butters would run around
                        for several episodes as Professor Chaos, only to have no one care much about his plots since
                        many of them had, though Butters did not realize it, already occurred on episodes of the
                        animated series The Simpsons. Butters would eventually reveal his secret identity of Professor
                        Chaos to Stan, although he mistook it for Butters coming out of the closet.</p>

                    <p>Though not anymore a member of the main four's group, Butters was nevertheless kept as a
                        prominent member of the boys' extended circle. Though he has returned, Kenny's role has declined
                        to an extent due to lack of ideas for the character and Butters has taken on a more prominent
                        role again. Despite their ill-treatment toward him, Butters stays loyal to his friends, perhaps
                        in hopes that they will accept him. In a way, this has worked as recently there seems to have
                        been some shift in the balance of friendship. The most obvious case of this being in "Tsst",
                        where Butters is calmly playing along with Stan, Kyle and Kenny, with Cartman being much more
                        alienated than usual, as well as in "Casa Bonita", where Kyle decides to take Butters with him
                        on his birthday to Casa Bonita instead of Cartman, implying he likes Butters more than Cartman.
                        It has been said that Kyle despises Cartman because of his cruel, sadistic and selfish
                        attitudes, as well as his prejudice—especially towards the Jews.</p>

                    <p>Despite their history, Butters has recently taken on the role as Cartman's sidekick. Cartman
                        often takes advantage of Butters' kindness and desire to be accepted in order to fulfill his
                        schemes. Cartman hurts and betrays Butters quite often, however, Butters continues to trust him
                        unconditionally. Despite this, Butters got even in "AWESOM-O", where he filmed Cartman dancing,
                        dressed up as Britney Spears, later showing it to South Park Elementary's various students and
                        faculty.</p>

                    <p>Butters is also a very famous celebrity in the nation of Mexico. In "The Last of the Meheecans",
                        Butters accidentally strays from Cartman's house and almost gets run over by a car. He is then
                        "refuged" in a house by a couple who thinks that Butters is a Mexican and is given the name
                        "Mantequilla", which is Spanish for Butter. They make him into their personal slave and then
                        dump him into an El Pollo Loco restaurant. Butters then goes with some Mexicans and crosses into
                        Mexico where he becomes a symbol of patriotism to the Mexicans. Butters realizes his popularity
                        in Mexico when he comes outside naked in front of hundreds of Mexicans. He realizes that every
                        time he raises his arms, the Mexicans cheer with joy. Butters is then made a fugitive by Cartman
                        but the U.S Border Patrol lets Butters back in and win the game of Texans vs. Mexicans. He is
                        allowed back into the U.S and shows his popularity to the other boys. In addition, he did not
                        get grounded by his parents for becoming famous in a foreign country despite being gone for more
                        than 2 weeks.</p>

                    <h4>Cupid Cartman</h4>

                    <p>Cupid Cartman, more commonly referred to as "Cupid Me", is an imaginary friend of Eric Cartman,
                        who is the only person who can see him. He first appears in the Season Sixteen episode "Cartman
                        Finds Love".</p>

                    <img src="/src/img/characters/minor_characters/cupid_cartman.webp"
                        class="cupid-cartman-image img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Cupid Cartman image">

                    <p>In "Cartman Finds Love", Cartman, who thinks black people belong together, plans to set up
                        Tolkien and Nichole in a relationship, by having them locked alone in the school gymnasium
                        overnight. After the two are rescued, Cartman secretly watches them, as they decide to pursue
                        the relationship. At that time, Cupid Cartman appears next to Cartman and they congratulate each
                        other.</p>

                    <p>When Tolkien and Nichole break up due to a misunderstanding, Cartman loses faith in Cupid Cartman
                        and beats him with a bat. Later, after watching a laxative commercial, which suggests "you have
                        to push even harder", he decides to apologize to Cupid Cartman and tries to get Tolkien and
                        Nichole back together again. After he succeeds in his plan, Cupid Cartman tells him he found a
                        girl for him too. When asked who she was, Cupid Cartman points to Stacy Muleburg, the Halitosis
                        Kidz! kid, much to Cartman's horror.</p>

                    <p>In "Tweek x Craig", Cartman attempts to use Cupid Cartman to bring Tweek and Craig together.
                        Cupid Cartman goes to Craig and shoots him with an arrow, as well as peeing in his mouth.
                        Afterwards, Cupid Cartman attempts to flirt with Cartman, who denies his advances because he
                        isn't gay.</p>

                    <p>Late in the episode, when Tweek and Craig "break up", Cartman asks Cupid Cartman to make things
                        right again, but he refuses to do so unless Cartman goes on a date with him. Cartman reluctantly
                        agrees and Cupid Cartman shoots Craig's dad with an arrow (and pees in his mouth) to get him to
                        accept Craig's "situation". At the end of the episode, Cupid Cartman gives Cartman a massage on
                        their date, which Cartman doesn't enjoy. He follows this by having anal sex with Cartman. This
                        all happens in Cartman's imagination, though, as in the next scene it is revealed he is actually
                        masturbating in the bathroom, as his mother watches.</p>

                    <h4>Craig Tucker</h4>

                    <img src="/src/img/characters/minor_characters/craig_tucker.webp"
                        class="craig-tucker-image img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Craig Tucker image">

                    <p>Craig Tucker is a member of the boys' fourth-grade class. Craig's most distinguishing physical
                        feature is his blue chullo hat topped with a yellow puffball. One of his traits is his
                        compulsive tendency to flip people off, usually for no discernible reason. He leads the group
                        known as Craig's Gang. He is one of the two children (along with Tweek Tweak) who are openly
                        gay.</p>

                    <p>While eight years old in the first three seasons, he was nine years old by "Fourth Grade", and as
                        of the Season Twelve episode "Pandemic 2: The Startling", he is ten years old, according to the
                        candles on his birthday cake. He also speaks with a rather deep voice, which is unusual for a
                        child at his age.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Craig seems to be the most stoic, cynical, apathetic, and deadpan kid in South Park, having a
                        more abrasive personality than the rest of the characters, a trait exaggerated by his
                        deeper-than-average voice. He has been described as pragmatic, monotone, and sarcastic. He also
                        appears to be more logical and mature than some of his peers, typically being the one to call
                        them out on their ignorance. He generally prefers to be left alone, harboring very few but
                        simple interests. In the making of South Park: The Fractured But Whole, it was written on a
                        whiteboard that he only cares about his guinea pig, and his boyfriend, Tweek.</p>

                    <p>Craig is implied to have bad behavior, and is referred to as "the biggest trouble-maker" in his
                        class by Eric Cartman in "Tweek vs. Craig". Craig has a habit of flipping people off, sometimes
                        to express irritation, anger, or disdain towards them, sometimes as a reflex. This is a trait
                        the official South Park website states is learned from his family,[3] who are all seen flipping
                        each other off in "Tweek vs. Craig". His habit of flipping people off has been shown much less
                        in later episodes, although a later incident regarding flipping off the principal of school
                        ended up with him in detention, and it is part of one of his abilities in South Park: The
                        Fractured But Whole.</p>

                    <p>The last time in the main series where he is seen making the gesture is "Fun with Veal", where he
                        and his parents are filmed by a cameraman, who gives them an interview. His parents are worried
                        and talk about a serious event that occurs in town, as Craig just remains blank-faced and flips
                        off the people who watch them on TV.</p>

                    <p>Due to his bad behavior, he is frequently sent to Mr. Mackey's office. Scenes involving a
                        character visiting Mr. Mackey's office will often show Craig sitting in the waiting seats
                        outside the door. Craig's most notable interview with Mr. Mackey was in "Rainforest
                        Shmainforest", where he flipped Mr. Mackey off several times and was sent to wait outside the
                        office again.</p>

                    <p>In earlier episodes, Craig normally has a blank face - even when flipping people off. This is
                        seen most predominantly in "Tweek vs. Craig" when he randomly flips off his entire family while
                        remaining a completely straight face. If his face is not blank, he is frowning for one reason or
                        another.</p>

                    <p>Although all the kids are violent, to an extent, Craig is shown to be the second most violent,
                        after Cartman, since he seems to be the primary initiator of several of the more severe
                        incidents of bullying that occurred at the school (e.g. Mark Cotswolds' duct-taping).</p>

                    <p>Craig is also shown to be one of the most skilled fighters in the class, shown beating up Mark
                        Cotswolds, attacking Kyle when Kyle chooses not to dress like a metrosexual, attacking Kenny
                        when Cartman frames him for having lice and beating up several Ginger Kids after Cartman's
                        speech. Contrarily, in "Tweek vs. Craig", he appears to have no idea how to fight at all and has
                        to take lessons in sumo wrestling. He wields a katana in "Good Times with Weapons" as well. And
                        in "Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society", he manages to knock both Tolkien and Butters unconscious
                        before being knocked out by Stan, when he uses a bone as a club to strike him.</p>

                    <img src="/src/img/characters/minor_characters/craig_tucker_2.webp"
                        class="craig-tucker-2-image img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Second Craig Tucker image">

                    <p>Later, his negative traits are subdued, as he is inclined to remain passive and stoical to
                        everything that happens around him. An early expression of this is displayed in "Red Hot
                        Catholic Love", in which he approaches his classmates in the bathroom and asks what was going
                        on. They tell him they are waiting for Cartman to defecate through his mouth. He only answers
                        "Oh" and leaves immediately.</p>

                    <p>During the "Pandemic" episodes, he makes remarks about Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny and their
                        habit of getting into trouble - he even walks away from them when they want to go deeper into an
                        Inca temple. However, at the end of the episode after he accidentally walks on the platform and
                        stopped the "Guinea Pirate", he simply lets out a deep sigh and accepts his fate. Craig never
                        once registers shock or any emotion whatsoever during this - he always says things flatly and
                        monotonously, even when he says "Okay. Now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes."</p>

                    <p>Craig has notable leadership skills, as he is the leader of a gang who is social rivals with
                        Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny. The first appearance of the group is in "Tweek vs. Craig", and
                        they are first acknowledged by the main characters in "How to Eat with Your Butt". The main
                        characters are first shown viewing Craig's gang as rivals in "South Park is Gay!". Cartman
                        refers to the gang as "Craig and those guys". The group usually consists of Craig, Clyde,
                        Tolkien, and sometimes Tweek, Jimmy, or Jason. Craig and Clyde seem to share/alternate in the
                        leadership of their group, although, given their designation, Craig is the primary leader.</p>

                    <p>Another example of Craig's abilities in leadership occurs in "Hooked on Monkey Fonics" when he
                        leads the male students in their plan to harm Mark Cotswolds. The episode also shows that his
                        assertiveness can also lead to bullying.</p>

                    <p>Craig competes more with the main characters than even the rest of his gang (see below). In
                        "Quest for Ratings", he opens a television show in the school entitled "Animals Close-Up With a
                        Wide-Angle Lens", which rivals their news show. However, he seems quite eager to help them at
                        other times, as in "Free Willzyx", in which he is one of the boys trying to get the orca back to
                        its "home" on the moon. Nonetheless, he rarely hangs out with the boys by himself, he is only
                        seen with them when the rest of Craig's gang is there.</p>

                    <p>In "Pandemic", Stan and Kyle's parents decide that they do not want Craig to hang around with
                        them since they had gone missing shortly after he joined the usual quartet. They deem him a
                        "troublemaker", although the Peruvian flute band was the others' idea, and Craig refused to join
                        them until he was told, "don't be an asshole."</p>
